# <img src="./public/acat-logo.svg" width="100" align="center"> ACAT - ACE Computational Automata Tool

The ACAT - ACE Computational Automata Tool implemented by the students of the Automatics, Computers and Electronics Faculty of the University of Craiova.

This tool intends to visually represent the abstract logic behind Automata and Formal Languages.

This is work in progress so any contribution is much appreciated.

For HOWTO stuff, please follow the readme files inside the src/ directory which will be updated from time to time.
